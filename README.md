## Summary
X-O game, also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a simple two-player
game played on a 3x3 grid. The game is won by the player who
successfully places three of their symbols (either X or O) in a
horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
The game was interfaced with a Tiva C microcontroller and a
Nokia5110 screen, along with 5 switches for player input(4 Directional Switches and 1 for place the symbol). The
Tiva C microcontroller, also known as the TM4C123GH6PM, is
a low-power, high-performance microcontroller that is widely
used in embedded systems.
